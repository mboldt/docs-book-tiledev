This topic explains how to document your service tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

When a PCF service tile launches on [PivNet](http://network.pivotal.io), Pivotal publishes corresponding documentation at [http://docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io) under **Partner Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry**.

This documentation is formatted in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/], stores in a Github repo that Pivotal creates, and is published with the bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder) platform.

## <a id="template"></a> Partner Documentation Template

The [PCF Partner Documentation Template](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partners-template) is a Github repository that you can clone to create documentation for your service tile that follows Pivotal's format and works with its documentation publishing platform, [bookbinder](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/bookbinder).

Documentation content resides in the `/docs-content` folder of the repository, as skeleton pages with embedded prompts for content that you should fill in, approximately following the [content descriptions](#content) below.

See the repo [README.md](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-partners-template/blob/master/README.md) for how to use the template with bookbinder to develop your documentation.

## <a id="content"></a> Documentation Content

While the specifics of your documentation will vary depending on the product, we have provided a basic blueprint below. At minimum, documentation should include #1 (Overview) and #2 (Installing/Configuring).

For a good example of a partner service doc, see the
[JFrog Artifactory docs](http://docs.pivotal.io/jfrog/index.html).

If you have questions or want to collaborate on drafting the documentation, feel free to hop on our Slack channel #pcf-docs. We’re always happy to help!

#### Partner Service Broker

A Service Broker allows Cloud Foundry applications to bind to services and consume the services easily from App Manager UI or command line. The Partner Service Broker will enable you to use one or more Partner accounts and is deployed as a Java Application on Cloud Foundry. The Broker exposes the Partner service on the Cloud Foundry Marketplace and allows users to directly create a service instance and bind it to their applications either from the Pivotal Apps Manager Console or from the command line. 

The PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry) Tile for Partner installs the Partner Service Broker as an application and registers it as a Service Broker on Cloud Foundry and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.  This makes the installation and subsequent use of Partner on your Cloud Foundry applications simple and easy.

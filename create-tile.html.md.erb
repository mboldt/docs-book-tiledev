The topics in this section explain how to create a tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), assuming you have a software service and have created a corresponding [service broker](./service-brokers.html) for PCF.

Topics:

* [Tile Generator](./tile-generator.html) describes the Tile Generator tool, which takes the source code and buildpack for your service, your service broker, and other software components, and generates a service tile and everything else needed to deploy your service to PCF.

* [Configuration](./tile-config.html) explains how to define configuration properties for your tile, and the blueprints that send the user-entered property values to your service.

* [Errands](./tile-errands.html) explains how to define lifecycle errands for your tile:
	- Post-install errands prepare a PCF deployment to run your service after your service tile installs.
	- Pre-delete errands clean up the deployment before your tile is removed.

* [Upgrading](./tile-upgrades.html) explains how to create the JavaScript Migration file that enables one-click upgrading for different versions of your tile.

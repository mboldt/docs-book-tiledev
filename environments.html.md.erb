This topic explains how to set up tile development environments, from simple standalone tools to a full PCF development environment. As you progress through the [stages](./stages.html) of tile development, you will likely also progress through these environments.

## <a id="pcfdev"></a> PCF Dev and BOSH Lite

Pivotal provides a lightweight (vagrant packaged) instance of PCF with some
basic services as a free product named PCF Dev. This is a great environment
to develop and test everything that runs in the Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime.

Either of these environments allow you to develop the first three levels of service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF): a [User-Provided Service](./roadmap.html), a [Brokered Service](./brokered.html), and a [Managed Service](./managed.html).

If your integration includes managed services, you will also need an instance
of bosh that can manage virtual machines and bosh releases for you.
[bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) works well for that
purpose.

Between these two components, you will have everything you need to develop
tiles, except for Pivotal's Ops Manager. But if you followed the recommended
[staged development approach](development.html) you will not need an actual full
PCF environment until the later phases of your development.

## Setting up bosh-lite

- [Install bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite)

!!! note "Note:"
	For this type of development environment, you only need bosh-lite
	itself to deploy managed service releases. You do **not** need to follow the
	instructions to Deploy Cloud Foundry in bosh-lite, as Cloud Foundry is
	provided by the PCF Dev installation above.

## <a id="pws">PWS or Other Supported CF Infrastructure</a>

Partners who participate in our program have access to a number of shared
PCF environments that are operated and managed by Pivotal. If you are not
(yet) in our program, need a dedicated environment, or want to be able to
work offline, you can set up your own environment. Often, a
[developer environment](#pcfdev) is sufficient for the early
phases of an integration effort. But eventually, you will need access to
a complete environment that includes Pivotal's Ops Manager on one of the
supported infrastructures:

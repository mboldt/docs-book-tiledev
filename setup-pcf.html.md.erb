# Setting up PCF

Partners who participate in our program have access to a number of shared
PCF environments that are operated and managed by Pivotal. If you are not
(yet) in our program, need a dedicated environment, or want to be able to
work offline, you can set up your own environment. Often, a
[developer environment](setup-pcfdev.html) is sufficient for the early
phases of an integration effort. But eventually, you will need access to
a complete environment that includes Pivotal's Ops Manager on one of the
supported infrastructures:

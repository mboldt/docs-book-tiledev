Pivotal provides a lightweight (vagrant packaged) instance of PCF with some
basic services as a free product named PCF Dev. This is a great environment
to develop and test everything that runs in the Cloud Foundry Elastic Runtime.

TK also mention PWS.

Either of these environments allow you to develop the first three levels of service for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF): a [User-Provided Service](./roadmap.html), a [Brokered Service](./brokered.html), and a [Managed Service](./managed.html).

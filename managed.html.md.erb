## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A managed service is a service deployed on Cloud Foundry infrastructure
(in other words, the same IaaS that your particular Cloud Foundry instance
is deployed on) by the same orchestration tool, [BOSH](http://bosh.io).
Offering your software as a managed service means that your PCF customers
will not have to learn different ways to deploy, manage, and monitor
different components of their application platform.

As with the brokered service, the service has a service broker and a tile listed on PivNet. PivNet lists managed services as "for PCF," without "Service Broker" in the name.

The next step is to get your service to actually be deployed on PCF rather
than externally. This is usually one of the more involved integrations, as you will have to change your packaging to allow your service components to be deployed by [BOSH](http://bosh.io) onto the PCF infrastructure.

To integrate your service at this level, you will have to learn about stemcells, BOSH releases, and manifests. You will also have to decide how your service maps to virtual machines and how persistent storage is managed.

### <a id="managed-mvp"></a> Minimal Viable Product

For a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) version of a managed service, we typically
recommend that you aim for a single, shared service instance, and don't yet
worry too much about High Availability of this instance. This integration level is mostly about getting the BOSH packaging, deployment, and monitoring working
correctly.
 
### <a id="managed-ha"></a> High Availability

Once you have a managed service, you may decide to prioritize either 
[on-demand provisioning](./on-demand.html) of service instances, or making your
single shared service instance more highly available.

When properly configured, BOSH monitors and restarts any failing processes
and virtual machines that are part of your service deployment. But to
further increase availability, you will have to think about spreading your
resources across multiple availability zones or even regions, and replicating
your persistent storage across those as well.

## <a id="create"></a> Create a Managed Service

For BOSH to manage your service, the major components needed are:

- **Packages** that can be installed on PCF stemcells to create virtual machine images
- **Jobs** that describe how to install, run, and remove your software
- A **Monitor** script, that describes how to monitor the health of your
service components and stop or restart them

## Shortcut - Start with Docker images

If you have already packaged your service as docker images, you can emulate
a managed service deployment using the [Tile Generator](tile-generator.html)'s
support for docker-bosh packages. This feature lets you deploy pre-existing
docker images into bash managed virtual machines on the PCF infrastructure.

While this is a great, easy way to deploy your service on PCF, we don't
recommend this as a long-term, production-ready solution. There is really no
benefit of running your service in containers on the VMs, and it does have
a number of operational ("day 2") drawbacks:

- You introduce more software (docker) which needs to be kept up-to-date, and
has the potential for bugs, downtime, and security vulnerabilities.
- You can no longer take advantage of the patching capabilities of PCF for
stemcells and application dependencies, like frameworks and libraries. Instead,
you become directly responsible for managing all software that is in the docker
images you deploy.

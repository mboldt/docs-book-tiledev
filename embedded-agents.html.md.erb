Some integrations depend on the ability to inject code into the application container.
Examples of this include:

- Application Performance Monitoring (APM) agents
- Container-embedded API gateways
- Client-side routers

We refer to these injected components as "container-embedded agents".
[Buildpacks](buildpacks.html) provide a mechanism to inject components into the application
container image, and the `.profile.d` directory provides a way to start agents before or
alongside the customer application.

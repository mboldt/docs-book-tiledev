title: Bosh-Lite and cf-release
owner: Services

If your integration includes managed services, you will also need an instance
of bosh that can manage virtual machines and bosh releases for you.
[bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) works well for that
purpose.

Between these two components, you will have everything you need to develop
tiles, except for Pivotal's Ops Manager. But if you followed the recommended
[staged development approach](development.md) you will not need an actual full
PCF environment until the later phases of your development.

## Setting up bosh-lite

- [Install bosh-lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite)

!!! note "Note:"
	For this type of development environment, you only need bosh-lite
	itself to deploy managed service releases. You do **not** need to follow the
	instructions to Deploy Cloud Foundry in bosh-lite, as Cloud Foundry is
	provided by the PCF Dev installation above.

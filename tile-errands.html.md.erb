Lifecycle errands are BOSH Errands (scripts) that run at the beginning and end of an installed product's availability time. Product teams create errands as part of a product package, and a product can only run errands it includes. Refer to [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/) for more information about BOSH Errands

Products can have two kinds of lifecycle errands. Post-install errands run after a product installs but before Ops Manager displays makes it available for use. Pre-delete errands run after an operator chooses to delete a product, but before Ops Manager finishes removing it from use. 

Under **Pending Changes**, the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard displays a list of both post-install and pre-delete errands.

 Operators can deselect any errands they do not want to run before clicking **Apply Changes**.

##<a id='post-install'></a>Post-Install Errands

Post-install errands run after a product installs, but before Ops Manager makes it available for use. Typical post-install errands include smoke or acceptance tests, database initialization or database migration, and service broker registration.

Most post-install errands run by default, but an operator can prevent a post-install errand from running by deselecting its checkbox under **Pending Changes** in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, or on the product tile's **Settings** tab, before installing the product.

For example, Pivotal MySQL has a **Broker Registrar** post-install errand that the Elastic Runtime tile uses to register its service broker with the Cloud Controller and publish its service plans.

If an operator deselects the checkbox for Elastic Runtime's **Broker Registrar** errand before installation, Elastic Runtime's service broker is not registered with the Cloud Controller, and its service plans are not made public.

##<a id='pre-delete'></a>Pre-Delete Errands

Pre-delete errands run after an operator chooses to delete a product, but before Ops Manager actually finishes deleting it. An operator can prevent a pre-delete errand from running by deselecting its checkbox under **Pending Changes** in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

Typical pre-delete errands include clean up of application artifacts and service
broker de-registration. For example, Pivotal MySQL has a **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete errand that:

* Purges the service offering
* Purges all service instances
* Purges all application bindings
* Deletes the service broker from the Cloud Controller

When an operator chooses to delete the Pivotal MySQL product, Ops Manager first
runs the **Broker Deregistrar** pre-delete errand, then deletes the product.
